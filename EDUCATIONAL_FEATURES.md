```python
class Assignment(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    course_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('course.id'))
    title = db.Column(db.String(200))
    description = db.Column(db.Text)
    due_date = db.Column(db.DateTime)
    max_score = db.Column(db.Float, default=100.0)
    assignment_type = db.Column(db.String(50))  # quiz, exam, project, etc.
    instructions = db.Column(db.Text)
    created_by = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
    is_active = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=True)
```

#### **AssignmentSubmission Model**
```python
class AssignmentSubmission(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    assignment_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('assignment.id'))
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
    submission_text = db.Column(db.Text)
    file_path = db.Column(db.String(500))
    submitted_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    score = db.Column(db.Float)
    feedback = db.Column(db.Text)
    status = db.Column(db.String(20))  # submitted, graded, late
```

#### **StudyProgress Model**
```python
class StudyProgress(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
    course_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('course.id'))
    material_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('course_material.id'))
    study_time_minutes = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
    completion_status = db.Column(db.String(20))  # not_started, in_progress, completed
    notes = db.Column(db.Text)
```
